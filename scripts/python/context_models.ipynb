       "\"welcome back to another meet kevin report today is a saturday february 4th and boy we have a lot to cover in today's not only are we going to talk about a cpi shocker coming up but we've got to talk about this chinese spy balloon we're going to talk about tesla and ford what are the ceo of ford just say that was probably the most ludicrous thing that i could possibly imagine and it was hilarious you're gonna love it the earnings call was great i've got the breakdown for you we'll talk about uh what hedge funds are up to what's going on with the federal reserve as well as a bunch of other things so a lot to cover let's get into it first we got to talk about a coming cpi shock because the initial estimates for january's cpi from economists are out and remember the next inflation report isn't until february 14th between then now we've got a few catalysts to go through so what i'll do is i'll hit what some of these catalysts are going to be in the coming couple weeks here coming 10 days and then i'll talk about what's going on with this cpi shock that we're expecting so let's hit some catalyst first and we'll just go in order so obviously today is saturday markets are closed but we want to prepare for monday monday we're going to start with pinterest pinterest is going to be really interesting from a consumer point of view because at least for my purposes i'm going to be looking at pinterest for a leading indicator on etsy sales i'm an investor in etsy because i really believe that etsy's got some real nice margins over a company like amazon because etsy is not doing the fulfillment i think fulfillment is a great way to sandbag your cash flow you're never going to get it faster you're better off letting ups fedex and amazon fulfillment and all that kind of stuff uh personally i don't want to be in that business because i think you're in a race to zero dollars of profit as soon as you get two days of shipping what happened let's go to one day then it's same day then it's going to be drone deliveries it's the most expensive thing you can get into in my opinion anyway pinterest i think is going to be a very interesting leading tell for advertisers as well because a lot of people spend money advertising and companies spend money advertising on pinterest including etsy sellers advertised on pinterest so interesting tells on the consumer uh we'll get some leading uh indicators for etsy we'll get some sort of more data on amazon although we already saw amazon's earnings but we'll also learn a little bit for advertisers what uh what are advertiser appetites like how does it compare to the advertising declines that we saw at google the slight beat but still reduction in advertising spend that we saw at facebook and what could it mean for trade desk coming up then on monday we'll also be talking activision activision blizzard they just settled with the sec for 35 million dollars for frat boy uh culture uh i'm not sure if the sec is taking that entire 35 mil i imagine part of that is going to the uh to the people who submit to these allegations to the women who submitted these allegations but uh obviously looking for insights here on activision blizzard to see hey are they actually going to get acquired by microsoft or is that deal going to get stuck in the mud take two interactive reports spirit airlines reports now spirit i think is actually leading potentially deflationary indicator we want to pay attention to because guess what folks if the discount airlines if the discount airlines start discounting even more guess what i think you're going to end up seeing pricing war from big boys american airlines united jetblue delta these companies are also going to get into a pricing war and we'll actually see a reduction in ticket prices which is a disinflationary aspect that we would love to see in the next inflation reports all throughout this year i'd love to see airfares actually come down keep in mind the airline industry is still trying to get back to equilibrium we're still not at 2019 levels of equilibrium you still have 10 fewer pilots about 15 percent fewer overall staff you've got substantially or you're you're already basically back to 2019 levels of travel and those will potentially exceed 2019 levels of travel so more travel less capability of servicing has led to a lot of deflation uh sorry has led to a lot of inflation let me correct my yourself there has led to prices rising obviously and we're hoping that balance starts coming back in the next few months especially as used car prices are expecting to potentially stabilize and that falling anchor of used car prices goes away so it'd be nice to see some pickup from airlines potentially competing a little bit more we'll see simon property group report on monday simon property group lar one of the largest mall owners in america they actually own some pretty good quality malls i i personally i like the company i like what they do i'm not a big fan of investing in commercial real estate not at this point i think valuations are quite stretched at this point in commercial real estate but we'll get some consumer insights here uh especially what kind of businesses are going uh bk basically especially not not sort of on the big scale like maybe uh bed bath and beyond but how many of the smaller stores are picking up and leaving uh you know there was a big belief that we're going to be able to go from a 2000 sort of 19 spending world to a covet everybody spends on world and the reopening everybody goes back to the mall but our people actually consistently going back to the most how is traffic looking now compared to the past tyson food we'll see if some meat prices are coming down what kind of inflationary aspects are we seeing for food or really great indicator tyson foods should be a great tell for us i'm a big fan of studying earnings and earnings calls for deflationary signs so far almost every single report i'm reading is indicating that the first half of 2023 still tough second half expected to be boom time now you know all of the ceos could be wrong but let's just say they weren't wrong in the last time around where in january of 2022 they're all like oh we're gonna have some inflationary problems sure enough we did uh tuesday we'll have hertz the rental car company i think it'll be interesting to see if uh we have any indicators on their interest in buying even more teslas uh this is something that they're actually a big fans of buying teslas and pole stars actually uh so we'll see if there's any kind of increase or or more motivation now after price drops to uh to potentially take advantage of uh uh some lower prices and buying some more electric vehicles we'll see apparently these rent very well people want to rent these and also keep in mind the network effects of renting cars when car companies rent out cars one of the neat things that happens is people go in the cars and they're like oh i kind of like this car and they potentially want to buy them rental car companies are a fantastic way for companies to advertise their car by actually letting people drive them without actually advertising their cars it's great uh you've got bp reporting tuesday you've got five serve which is uh the traditional sort of more legacy fintech if you will company that also processes a ton of transactions i think they're they represent over 50 percent of retail store transactions think of them as checkout terminals old cash registers baby obviously they're trying to change with the times but we'll get some insight on consumer spending from them dupont is an industrial we'll see what's going on with industrials so far from 3m and down we've gotten a lot of indicators of layoffs uh industrial layoffs are often the last leg to fall in a recession so we'll see does this mean we're just getting started or does this mean we're over the pain who knows if you look at the bond market the pain hasn't even really started yet because of the inverted yield curve and the depth of the inversion the pain is usually during the re-stepening phase and we've barely started that kkr real estate you know these real estate companies again i think they're terribly overvalued but i'm curious to see what kind of redemptions uh and or how the company's planning on handling the massive redemption requests they're getting so far companies like blackstone and kkr are not fulfilling all of their redemption requests that's basically what investors are like dude uh we want to get our money out we want to go buy other stuff and the company's like yeah sorry the market's trash and we don't want to but if the company gets forced to then they might have to liquidate real estate which could lead to a large bump in real estate inventory keeping in mind that after that jobs report we got a nice little take up again in that 10-year treasury yield when you get that tick up in the 10-year treasury you end up pushing mortgage rates up with it so something to pay attention to is mortgage rates rising more liquidations at rates a little bit of a risk and phase reports on tuesday i do think that end face is is one of the most phenomenal companies that you should consider as an investment obviously hashtag not personalized financial advice for you but i think it's a phenomenal company however there are massive risks i think all enface has to do is say hey we're starting to see a drop off in residential customers being interested in ordering uh solar panels because they're worried about the housing market going down yeah that's gonna that could sandbag that stock you really need growth at in phase now the stock has thankfully sold off from the the insane valuations of the 330s into the low 20s i actually picked up a few more shares in the low 200s uh but uh but but you know there's there's still a big risk here now for me i look at this and go hey look if end face falls yeah if we can get to that 160 level i kind of want to start backing up the truck potentially so we'll see and face i think is a phenomenal company chipotle reports on tuesday now i am really excited about chipotle and now chipotle is one of those that they've managed to figure out pricing power with rice and beans and it's phenomenal now what's also really incredible about chipotle though is they're one of the leading companies coming out right now saying look we're hiring 15 000 people for burrito season i didn't even know burrito season was a thing i live in california uh and uh it's like every day is burrito season here i think i have burritos like three times a week okay it's just what we do out here burritos are freaking awesome uh anyway and i also by the way just learned like fun fact i never knew this cilantro is actually not an american word it's a spanish word for uh coriander and i'm like hmm never knew that the only reason i learned that is because my dad uh was saying he was going to cook something and he was going to put coriander on it which is the same word in german coriander and i'm like what what is that so i translate it and and uh it translates to coriander in english too and i'm like it's just spelled with a c instead of a k and i'm like i don't know what that is so so i google it that's enough or it's cilantro the the spanish word for it i'm like oh never knew anyway so uh apparently they're hiring about 15 000 people for uh for burrito season if you actually go to their website you'll see right now chipotle has like 3 200 job openings on their website just like insane how much they're hiring but the leading indicator is probably the best from chipotle in that chipotle is is bluntly saying look it's becoming easier for us to hire people in other words pp from people are are getting smaller wage earners pricing power is going down their pp is going down and that is leading to more capabilities of businesses who want to expand in a recession to actually hire now i actually think that's phenomenal i'm a big fan and massive believer then in a recession you double down on your business if you're a business owner right and you prepare to take market share so that way when you're in that next bull run you're a force to beat reckoned with that that's that's my my thesis and so i'm a big fan of doubling down i think that's exactly what chipotle is doing here and i respect that i think that's awesome so we'll see what happens with chipotle that is uh tuesday we've got consumer credit also coming out on tuesday tuesdays consumer credit numbers we are looking at 25 trillion versus a prior release of 27.96 uh that would be good because consumer credit has been skyrocketing and it's time for that to come down a little bit trade balance is expected to come in at about negative 68.5 keep in mind that every time consumer credit skyrockets people start panicking over the the idea that uh consumers are going into massive loans just to sort of sustain uh their uh their their earnings and uh or sort of i should say their spending in march of 2022 we hit 46 billion dollars of consumer uh uh consumer credit which was insane it was one of the largest numbers ever in june and we hit 39.7 it's recently come down to a low of 23 so if we can sort of resettle back to maybe a longer term average that would be good pre-pandemic consumer credit had a high of about 27 which is roughly the survey we expect now and it averaged closer to about 22 on sort of a monthly basis and during the pandemic there were times obviously consumer credit even went negative people were just paying off their debt they're like oh my god everything's gonna work and the world's gonna end uh yeah that was a crazy time anyway uh wednesday we have a wholesale trade coming out as well as some other earnings of course we'll review those wholesale trade is expected to be negative 0.2 percent in wholesale inventories on the month over month basis expected to be point one we have uber coming out i don't have too much to say about uber i personally i think uber and lyft are services that i don't think could ever really make a profit i think the drivers are the ones who are going to monetize most of the profit and anything that's really left ends up getting spent on opex at these companies that's not necessarily to say they're bad companies i mean after all they provide food for all of their employees basically right they provide pay for all their employees so you know having a company that that makes no money is not necessarily a bad thing because all the people working there make money i just don't think it's a good investment because that means the investors aren't making money uh then you've got cvs and disney disney coming out on wednesday now disney is going to be interesting because disney is going through this this phase of cannibalizing all of the hard-working people's efforts at the parks and the cruise lines uh and and really the the sector that makes money for disney disney makes a crapload of money at their parks people are spending more money than ever 50 percent more per person spending per capita spending at disney parks right now it's insane people are going nutty okay like people love of spending money at disney but the brand value is huge even though they they write their goodwill as even lower than teletox which is like hilarious to me disney is a quality brand okay we know that unless of course we want to start talking politics and then we can have debates about don't say gay and and then everybody's gonna start getting fussy and go what do you mean what are you some libra who loves disney we're not going to get into that okay we're talking about pp here okay we're not going to talk about children politics we're going to talk about pp pricing power and their brand has a lot of pricing power now the question is and and sure some of that politically has been reduced a little bit but uh the question is really how much money is disney going to keep throwing into the entertainment world of disney plus because that's the big money sync right now it's kind of like a metaverse situation where on one hand you've got facebook taking in all this money from advertising but what are they doing they're dumping it all into the metaverse and that's a little bit disappointing for investors because you've got a profitable segment that's feeding a not so profitable business now the hope obviously with disney plus is that disney plus can continue to grow subscriber base but also grow faster and better than netflix obviously disney plus came out a whole lot later than netflix but as of late they've still been growing better than netflix and the goal obviously keep that going but also i think the biggest most interesting part for disney for me is how is the advertising going because so far netflix suggests the advertising isn't actually going that great uh that they're having a rougher sign up period and that they're potentially even considering going to a freemium model where basically they give free netflix service but then you get a bunch of ads because they're just not getting a lot of people signing up for the pay and still have ad service that's actually not a terrible surprise to me but disney's trying something like this as well and i'm very curious to see what kind of indicators we can get from disney for my favorite trade desk and connect the tv advertising so far it's not looking that great for advertising though i've got my fingers crossed that trade desk can still grow in this recessionary environment might take an l on that one though so we want to be careful on that robin hood wednesday now i'm very curious also to see how they're potentially making money because even though we know companies like sofi are making more money by attracting depositors offering a higher yield for savings accounts attracting depositors and then lending those deposits out and making money on loans robin hood doesn't do lending other than margin lending and margin lending is falling but they're also now offering 4.15 percent on cash deposits which by the way is really good like if you've got cash sitting around in my opinion you stick it into like a wealth runner robin hood i don't care what you use uh and milk that yield that's incredible like why bother dealing with treasuries when you could just milk that it's great it gives you that liquidity too instant liquidity it's phenomenal so what we've got to consider uh with uh with robin hood is they're paying out a lot of uh their yield basically what they could be earning in the market on cash deposits that they have and so i'm curious to see as that spreads compression or compressing is there revenue going down we'll see and we have had a couple green months here uh in the stock market or maybe at least a green january we'll see if that was maybe it will get maybe a good better set of guidance for the first quarter of the year uh from robin hood but no guarantees then we'll also get a firm really big consumer spending play here but i think biggest part for a firm is how are those default rates i don't think a firm's really been around long enough to actually be popular during a recession and now we're in a recessionary environment and a firm's basically playing the first rodeo recession now a firm likes to argue that oh well people need us more in a recession sure but are they burning you more in a recession we'll see goodyear reports win reports on wednesday mattel reports that if you look at sort of uh the the earnings that we've already gotten from companies like hasbro games like toys not looking good so big red flag there for mattel we'll see how much of that is already priced in uh consumer and inflationary spend obviously for goodyear will be interesting and then also win how's travel doing how's macau doing how is the reopening going in china from the macau's point of view uh and to me that's actually going to be a starbucks towel because i'm i'm pretty excited about what i'm seeing at starbucks so then on thursday we get uh pepsi pepsi pepsi uh we'll see what kind of inflationary costs we're getting a pepsi uh we've got toyota credit suisse paypal lyft cloud flare now that'll be a big one for software service spend if bill.com is any tell cloudflare is going to get reamed software service companies especially ones that are not profitable are probably not going to do too well in the next few earning seasons so there's a big red flag for cloudflare however if it can beat on forecasts it could move bigly we'll see i i would expect the implied volatility for cloudflare is probably in excess of uh 15 percent for for uh a moving earnings kind of especially following the bill.com and we can actually find out what that is by looking at what the implied volatility is on earnings day next week and it is oh i was close 12.1 is the implied volatility the average volatility for the stock is uh generally uh for earnings is 5.9 so you've got two and a half times as much volatility expected for these sas companies on friday we get the university of michigan inflation expectations read and then the week after that we get cpi which we've just got some of our initial surveys in for let me first hit u of m sentiment and then we'll also look at these cpi forecast uh after this stream by the way we're going to start working on changing the pricing as we promised and removing that coupon for the programs on building your wealth link down below i just wanted to give you a heads up in case you're wondering like hey it's still there it's like yep just woke up don't worry we're going to change that so uh we'll get those changes done today uh all right so what do we got here u of m sentiment and current conditions and expectations the survey says 65 for sentiment 68 for current conditions expectation 63 these are all slightly higher than the last with the exception of current conditions slightly lower but what's interesting to me is the survey actually shows the one year inflation expectation moving up slightly from 3.9 to 4 ideally we come in low on that the most important thing right now is that we keep inflation expectations low and anchored that's the most important thing as we go forward especially after a hot jobs report for january which we could try to explain away but let's just be real it's all going to come down to inflation and inflation expectations right now as well it's worth noting that inflation expectations are on the via the five-year break even are still sitting at about 2.3 uh we can look at this graphically as well here on screen now if you're watching we can see we're sitting at 2.3 that downtrend is really strong very very strong downtrend no matter how you slice it however we are still substantially higher than where we were in 2018 especially the fed went delvish right around here at this bar which sits you at about 1.6 for the five-year break even we're sitting at 2.3 right now so we've still got some work to do however this really reiterates the the nike swoosh scenario of of a stock market recovery if we slowly start seeing it coming down here uh we shall see next inflation report as well with expectations this is sort of the expectation set we've been waiting for uh so far we do not have all of the expectations for example we do not yet have a survey in on year over year inflation expectations but we do have some month over month numbers and i think this is actually very interesting cpi month over month survey last month the actual result was a negative 0.1 this spot for january it's expected to be 0.5 that's a really high survey i'm actually really bullish on that even look listen if this survey comes in really high guess what it's really easy for it to miss to the low side because if it comes in at point four you still win you see what i mean now 0.5 though on the month over month pretty up there and this is not the core measure this is the headline measure and it has to do with energy prices having risen now 0.5 again it's hot that's a that's a six percent annualized rate of inflation that's not great we don't want to see six percent annualized inflation we want to see less something around two percent so we'll really have to pay attention to the core serving now the core survey is not out yet but it really sets us up for a shocker now we do have a core month-to-month survey though uh sorry uh oh yeah we do have a core month-to-month survey uh we just don't have core year over year okay so the core month-to-month survey taking out food and energy is actually also expected to come in hotter last month we were sitting at point three percent which is 3.6 percent annualized this month the forecast is point four so both of these month over month reads are setting up for a a high report again though if we go in with high expectations it's easier to miss to the downside which is nice we want that now not considering core for a moment if we just consider the headline we could look at what's been going on with oil and what we'll find in the last three months is we had a spike in january which this helps explain some of that headline inflation look at this starting at the first week of january we actually ran up on brent that's your international crude oil cost per barrel we ran up to about 84 to 87 and we sat there quite a bit under this trade thesis that uh oh here we go you've got uh a lot of inflationary pressure because of the chinese reopening but what's remarkable about that because i don't think the chinese reopening is going to lead to that much inflation is what do we have over here you've got this decline in oil prices international oil prices again to under 80. so you're actually now starting to get to the same levels that we had the first week of january and some of the lows that we had the first week of december so i'm excited to see those inflationary pressures on the headline go down and hopefully stay down but what about core because that core month over month uh even though we don't have the year-over-year estimates yet that core month over month is very interesting to me point four why is core expected to rise is it because those used cars so unexpected to go down as much is it because we're not seeing airfares come down as much yet is it because household data isn't coming in weak yet and so even though that core coming in at 0.4 would be expected to be weaker uh than than where we have been which has been anywhere between 0.5 to 0.6 in the middle of last year it's still hot we'd still like to see this come in at say 0.1 or 0.2 so we could really reiterate that disinflationary narrative that's needed in core now be careful though so far we only have like six to ten estimates coming in for some of these early estimates what's going to happen over the next week is we're going to get many more economists providing their estimates and we know they could be crazy off and wrong but at least it'll give us some kind of guide of what the market wants to be and as long as we can beat those estimates the market usually goes up so we like that we like it where as the market goes up unless of course you're a short seller anyway this gives us a breakdown of some of the massive catalysts coming in the next two weeks you'll notice there actually aren't that many other than the inflation report and really the next fomc meeting is not until march 22nd so we've got another five six weeks here before we have to deal with the fed again that's also where we're going to get a new summary of economic projections that summary of economic projections is going to be critical because we want to see a softening from december but that's softening from december i think is only going to get written into that summer of economic projections if the cpi report coming up actually comes in weaker than expected fingers crossed all righty then let's see what we got here so we got a question uh we have apple last report uh 2022 versus the 2021 see the dates in the report they added an extra week of sales sales loss was more than expected yeah this is true um so a lot of people are pissed that apple stock went up on friday i think a lot of people wanted to buy the dip and then they couldn't because the stock price actually went up and so people are like what is going on here this was ridiculous uh and uh the reality is the market doesn't so much care about that extra week i think it was very well disclosed that there was an extra week i think what the market cares about is uh this idea that hey what's what caused the sales miss yeah the sales miss seemed to be caused at least if you listen to tim cook by supply chain issues now personally i wonder is that a cop-out are we actually going to see those supply chain issues resolve and then all of a sudden all this crazy demand come back for iphones uh which missed wearables which missed and max which missed ipads was the only thing that b who knows maybe after all ipads had the worst supply chain issues last year for apple and now we're beating so maybe because they're becoming available again that's why we're seeing those beats who knows we'll see we will see so wonder bread ass boy says stop spreading fud you know your name tells me how seriously i need to take you lyft is already profitable uber can never well we'll see their profitability next week when they report is this real me kevin or someone rebroadcasting him asks jumpy bumpy 69 from twitch yeah i am multi-streaming from on youtube facebook and twitch right now so you can watch on any of those platforms apparently i can't stream on twitter but who knows all right next up we gotta talk about the balloon we gotta talk about my thesis on the balloon what's going on with the balloon i shorted the market for the first time in two years the dump is coming too far too fast ouch welcome brian anthony thanks for being a new member all right stand by we gotta talk about this crazy chinese a spy balloon because uh yesterday i jokingly tweeted which of course i encourage you to follow me on twitter you could see some of the crazy stuff that i post uh there at realmeet kevin but yesterday i posted this crazy post that here is a leaked photo of u.s airspace tomorrow following biden's harsh actions today and this post was inspired by the fact that we didn't shoot down the large chinese spine balloon and uh my joke was that there are now going to be eight of them in the sky and obviously i'm being facetious because i don't actually expect they're gonna be like eight of them in the sky but i photoshopped an image of eight of them in the sky anyway for the lulls now what's remarkable is no earlier or or should i say no later than five o'clock yesterday do i get a message or a notification then now all of a sudden the second chinese spy balloon has been discovered in latin america and apparently china is sending them all over the place now we have no idea how many of them there are these instances have come up in the past but apparently now there are two chinese fiber balloons floating around now it's remarkable and i'm going to give some thesis in terms of my theorist what's actually happening here because i've got an idea apparently and allegedly and i don't know if this was like an after the fact backlash and so they wanted to politically re-engineer the message but some people are saying hey joe biden actually wanted to shoot down the plane but for the pentagon's like no no you can't shoot it down because the damn balloon is like they're the size of three school buses wide and if you shoot it down what ends up happening you end up getting a lot of a debris field and if you have a debris field guess what uh yeah it might potentially end up hurting people and that's not good sure but then again the darn balloon was also floating around montana and kansas and let's just say there's plenty of open space for you to calculate the trajectory of you shooting this thing down and at landing where they ain't nobody you gotta worry about now obviously uh who knows what actually happened did joe biden say let's shoot it down after he got a bunch of backlash on the internet or did that happen before nobody knows but canada apparently first saw the spy balloon coming through their airspace and kind of floated over the pacific ocean from china and through canada and then down through montana obviously the concern is hey man why y'all flying spy balloons where we've got military bases around the heart of america china's like no it's just a weather balloon it's just following the jet stream we can't control it but then yesterday the wall street journal is like wait a minute the darn thing just changed manu it just maneuvered into a different direction it obviously is controllable the chinese are controlling this it's probably not a weather balloon well no duh it's probably not the weather balloon you know what because china tells us oh well it's just a weather balloon and it's conducting other scientific research as well sure let's fly a balloon uh you know somewhere around 60 000 feet in the air above america and get substantially better real-time imagery of america than we could get from satellite it's kind of interesting now what's also very interesting and this is where i want to get into my thesis as to what's actually happening here because obviously the pentagon doesn't want to shoot this thing down although there were some videos on twitter of what looked like potentially something getting shot down nobody really knows what this was yet uh but i also tweet replied to it yesterday and i'm like uh what is going on here so i'll go ahead and play that it's basically apparently a video from montana where somebody says a military jet just buzzed a neighborhood and so after a military jet buzzed the neighborhood this person takes out their camera and starts filming and you get this footage of what looks like something being shot down i you know can't actually confirm that with a malicious intent uh hold on here i don't think we have audio there i don't know that there is actually audio oh there we go okay so you get some kind of flash and some kind of boom i'll replay that yeah so basically what you have is something that looks like you know comet in the sky big contrail of something falling and uh there's some sort of explosion in the sky we don't know if that was uh just the breaking the sound barrier like a jet breaking the sound barrier that's entirely possible we don't know if something was actually shot down it certainly looks that way from the picture the pentagon in the white house say no nothing was shot down and then the balloon was no longer spotted in montana it's been spotted in kansas and and now it's expected to be somewhere over by tennessee now then it begs the question are there multiple spy balloons already well given that we saw another one in latin america maybe there are who knows but what we do know is exactly what colleen here says china lies about everything well yeah there's no doubt about that but i think nobody actually in china believes that america believes this is a spy balloon let me tell you what i think this actually is starting with where it is so the spy balloon is floating around at 60 000 feet now that is above our air traffic our air traffic's generally at 30 to 35 000 feet and private jet travel is somewhere around 40 to 45 000 feet now what's interesting about that is private jets like a citation that was flying uh i think it was a latitude that was flying around kansas actually reported a derelict balloon floating just a few thousand feet above it and they report this to the faa uh and i think the message that's being sent is hey we're really here's china really trying to purposefully toy with your airspace even though we're at that safe level 60 000 feet or close to private jet travel is kind of a way of saying hey we're just going to taunt you america usually we fly spy balloons between 80 to 100 000 feet why don't we fly this spy balloon at sixty thousand feet so that way the private jet people can see it and the americans can see it from the from the ground and it sends an uncertainty it sends a signal to americans of oh my gosh the chinese are watching us on top of that it sends a message to the biden administration of look y'all aren't doing anything right even though maybe they want to and they're choosing not to whatever it's china's way of basically telling americans you should be afraid of china because your government ain't gonna do anything about us and you know why this is happening in my opinion this is retaliation for two big things number one the chips act sanctioning china and limiting the export of high quality advanced manufacturing chip machines like advanced lithography machines from asml the dutch company to china a dutch company is not allowed to sell advanced lithography machines to china because america said so china is like how dare you f you now people are like why can't a dutch company sell products to china well because if they do the united states will say fine we won't do business with you anymore and guess who does the most business for advanced chips with companies like taiwan semiconductors obviously taiwan semiconductors doesn't really like what's going on in china and asml obviously america because not only do we have the largest ship demand in the world we also have the largest demand for through our chip demand uh chip making equipment from companies like asml even other companies like intel intel is the third largest chip manufacturer in america and it's expected to spend over a hundred billion dollars making new chip making plans over the next three to four years it's going to be a lot of chip making capacity and a lot more orders for chip manufacturers or or chip equipment manufacturers again like that dutch company smll and so what does asml not want to do they don't want to lose american business so they comply so who loses what we lose in part because things get more expensive when you cut out part of the world right consumers always end up losing when it comes to sanctions because things become more expensive that's just simple econ 101 we won't go through that sort of explanation but what's more important is china gets pissed because china's like you're saying we have to take the old like third generation or like the old generation crap and you guys get all the new stuff all the advanced stuff and america's like yeah what are you gonna do about it and china is kind of like the little toddler talking to their parent like the parent is obviously stronger but the toddler is starting to grow up a little bit and they realize that well even though they may get thrown in time out they could still throw crap down the stairs and piss you off and that's kind of what china is doing because it's sending the signal of hey hey we can we can fight back too obviously that's somewhat what china is doing here they're trying to purposefully oh look fox is playing it right now on tv there's there's a video of it pentagon confirms second chinese balloon in my opinion what you have is you have china trying to create a retaliatory saber-rattling environment for america and send the signal that if you limit us from being able to buy chips and you keep doing business with taiwan well we'll do missile tests we'll do military tests we'll fly balloons over your country and you know what that's politically going to look bad for you because guess what you're too much of a weenie baby to actually shoot him down and because he ain't gonna shoot him down we're gonna look great and then guess what we're gonna do the more you sanction us the more balloons we're gonna launch the more stupid crap we're gonna do to make americans feel worried about china because the more americans are worried about china the more americans are going to call into their congress people and go do something we hate that our administration and congress people aren't going to do anything we're not going to vote for you anymore and then in some degree that actually makes politicians go maybe we don't want to be so harsh on china because i'm losing votes over here see how it's all like a game of 4d chess i think china really gives a crap about what they can't already see with satellites this higher resolution imagery you think they really give a crap what nancy's doing in her backyard in san francisco although they didn't fly over san francisco uh and there's probably not much going on in the backyard over there anyway you think we really care what karen's are doing in montana in their backyards or what these military facilities look like that have our icbms and nuclear warheads in the middle of nowhere we really think china really needs a weather balloon to spot that and that they'd really be so dumb to signal some form of like impending attack of course not because there is no impending attack it's all just saber rattling it's for the show it's designed to make everybody talk about china and guess what when everybody talks about china it puts political pressure on politicians to do something it makes them look weak and then they get pissed because they don't want to look like little weenie babies but now they do look like winnie weenie babies and so guess who wins china so whether or not you actually shoot the balloon down china wins because china says we are a loose cannon even though they won't ever actually do anything well no guarantees just knock on wood but that's the signal they're trying to send is hey we can look what we just did we just flew a balloon over your country and you did nothing y'all weak it's all gamesmanship that's all this whole balloon thing is i mean look at it look at this look at the caption on fox news i mean it's no surprise on fox news biden silent on chinese five balloon right let's elicit for a moment i mean in montana we have an air force base uh we have about a third of our uh strategic uh missile defense silos scattered across so here's a republican the governor of montana and what's he doing he's bagging on the democratic leadership obviously that pisses off the dems and that is how china wins china wins by fox news showing all the voting people the voting people wake up early okay the old people wake up early and watch fox and friends and us who will watch it now okay and if you're old i respect you if you're young i respect you too i think it's great i like waking up early but everybody's different you know no shade on somebody who wants to replay it later it doesn't matter to me uh but look this is exactly the media attention china wants they wanted this sucker to be seen because it's part of psychological warfare that's what this is it's so simple nobody gets hurt except americans feelings and that's what china is doing in my opinion in retaliation for taiwan nancy pelosi visiting taiwan kevin mccarthy potentially promising to visit taiwan and the chips act china's pissed they want the advanced chips because advanced chips guess what advanced ships go into bombs they go into missiles they go into computers and they go into things that people buy like iphones and people want the advanced chips and the latest and greatest who wants to buy an old chip or a phone nobody everyone wants the latest and greatest so who wins america america wins militarily america wins with product sales and china loses and china's pissed about that china doesn't want to lose china already got embarrassed enough with the covet zero lockdowns so now they're just waving their little saber around in the air again and that's exactly what you have going on here it's simple psychological warfare that's it now i understand we could get you know we like let me just put it this way and i'm not going to comment on it beyond just reading it out loud joe can't do anything china owns joe and hunter they have given both millions all right and that is my talk on the chinese balloon yes so that's psychological warfare 101 for you all righty so um let me take a listen here for a moment what what is what is fox talking about here i lived in nebraska when i was a kid yeah we'll talk about that afterwards okay uh well and so this is not that cold are you sitting here thinking why are these guys complaining about this cold because we can tell you that's the rockefeller center isn't it pete and rachel and will are sorry come on they're inside the studio complaining that it's cold take a look at the weather map show you what's going on it is obviously really cold here these are the actual air temperatures and of course it gets okay i don't know why we're looking at the weather right now uh sorry um i got distracted for some reason uh all right so uh now we have to talk about what else do we have to talk about there's a lot okay here we go next oh we gotta talk about elon baby elon elongate uh elon and ford oh this is going to be a fun one elon musk and ford oh boy we've got a lot to talk about when it comes to elon musk and four elon musk just got the results of his lawsuit not only that but ford has some insane things to say and boy it's gonna make all the tesla people nervous or will it we'll talk about all of that in this video so first musk and tesla were sued with potential damages as high as 6 to 12 billion dollars for elon musk's august of 2018 tweet taking tesla private at 4 20. the sec alleged that that tweet was false that elon musk had no rational basis for making that tweet elon musk replied and said i totally did not only did i have goldman sachs and bankers lined up to fund it but the saudi arabian private investment fund was essentially providing me with a handshake deal that they they would help me buy out tesla and even though later there was some confusion and some backtracking on that handshake deal elon musk believes that at the time he made the tweet he was completely correct in making the tweet the sec ended up settling with elon musk and finding him 20 million dollars requiring elon musk to have a twitter babysitter that is somebody who monitors elon musk's tweets before he actually posts his tweets now i actually doubt that happens but so far the sec has been relatively silent on whether or not elon musk actually is maybe because he hasn't been tweeting stuff like taking tesla private at 420 anymore and most of his tweets have turned more into political tweets but anyway moving on from that settlement which elon musk says he was forced into because otherwise banks were going to limit access to his wholesale lines of credit which would have stalled model 3 production at tesla and led to a potential tesla bankruptcy what happened today fast forward investors say they didn't make enough money on their tesla option and trade contracts and they missed out on the rally and even though the judge in the san francisco district judge chan ended up telling the court elon musk tweets about testing taking tesla private at 420 funding secured were untrue even though the judge said elon musk tweets were untrue which would have easily set up for an appeals court claim because that could be deemed a lack of due process despite that the jury ended up deciding that elon musk had no liability and making the tweet funding secured and any of the trade losses that people incurred or lack of additional gains that people wanted were the fault of people themselves so the entire class action lawsuit was dismissed and this is shocking given that it was in a san francisco court this happened which goes to show that even people in san francisco realized what happened to elon musk is bs which is pretty dang impressive now don't get me wrong i like people in san francisco i think they're very smart and intelligent people and i think this shows justice because it shows that the people are not as loony as the political system is in san francisco i think the judge system the judicial system in san francisco is substantially more rigged now don't get me wrong okay i'm gonna go slight tinfoil hat here but i highly believe it i have been in san francisco courts i represented myself because i had to fire my attorney in a san francisco court because i couldn't get any democratic attorney to represent me why because i was running for governor against the democratic governor and nobody wanted to be seen as representing somebody fighting the democratic governor because if you take a democratic attorney into a democratic court while you're trying to replace the existing governor nobody else wants to work with that attorney because you can't go against the existing governor how dare there be a free political process but here's the part that could potentially be slightly rigged of california courts and is potentially why judge chan okay again maybe slightly tinfoil had here but potentially why judge chan went hard on elon musk suggesting to the jury that elon musk tweets or falls judge chan is a democratic judge in the san francisco district democratic judges in the san francisco district have a very close relationship to the governor of california now why does that matter well it matters a lot because the governor of california anytime he gets sued his cases end up in courts in northern california san francisco and sacramento courts northern district courts and guess what those judges want they want to be in the good graces of the governor now why would judges in northern california want to be in the good graces of the governor of california oh that's right because the governor of california is usually seen as a stepping stone to become president oh well that's interesting so if you're the governor of california maybe you want to run to be president one day which is exactly what gavin newsom is basically revving up to do should joe biden not run for president in 2024 we widely expect gavin newsom to step in now why is that really interesting because if gavin newsom were to become president guess what the president does ah they appoint federal judges that means you take judges from the state level and you move them up to federal judges and guess what federal judges get to potentially become supreme court judges and so you got to kind of stroke the governor as a california judge to have hopes that the california governor becomes president and then potentially you get promoted to a federal judge and maybe a supreme court judge in the future it's all part of the game so when i say i'm putting on my tinfoil hat let's be real some of that stuff actually happens it's all long-term planning okay this is why the judicial system in california really mirrors whatever the hell the governor wants so if you go against the governor even if you have a great argument you're more likely to lose now what do we have to say about elon musk and tesla well first it's great that elon musk and tesla don't have to actually deal with a potential 6 to 12 billion dollar liability although if this did end up being a loss that's 6 to 12 billion dollar liability would have probably been settled down to 500 million to a billion dollars but it's nice and after hours after the court case was decided tesla stock did rise about two percent it never really made it to 200 though so good news for those of you who do not want me to dye my hair green i will not be dying my hair green tesla did not make it it came within a dollar and one cent and it just couldn't make it it just didn't have the pricing power to make it there however what you did end up having was tesla increasing prices for some of its model wise model y long range was increased 2.8 percent model y a standard was increased 1.8 or 1.75 percent however the model 3 rear rear wheel drive vehicle was dropped in price one point 0.1 so you've had some small pricing adjustments and you did also have the irs and treasury department finally providing the appropriate clarity that was needed to indicate that now all model y vehicles actually qualify for the full 7 500 federal tax ev credit including model wise that sell up to an eighty thousand dollar msrp up from fifty five thousand dollars this is a great win for not just tesla but quite frankly any ev manufacturer so this is fantastic it is great that these tax credit rules have been clarified so good win on the lawsuit by musk we learned a little bit about the rigged system we learned about ev tax credits but what the hell did ford just do okay ford this is a laughable one this i'm gonna bring you first to the most salient part of the forward earnings call and i have to tell you this part was ridiculous because they basically sell you a stock that isn't ford and that's the funny part so first what we want to do is we want to go to an analyst rob lash rob latch asks the question considering everyone's aspirations for growth in electric vehicles do you think you could stand by pricing assumptions and maybe in another way of asking this do you think you can sell and i'm putting this on screen now as well so you can see him just reading this verbatim from the earnings call transcript okay this is what i do by the way i read this stuff with my team team by the way amazing team now i used to do all this stuff alone now i get to do more content because i've got a great team helping me these guys are awesome team's amazing you'll rock uh but anyway do you think you can sell a forty thousand dollar electric crossover with a 20 gross margin now why would rod latch be asking this question because tesla folks tesla said worst case scenario their gross profit margin would be 20 percent so in other words rod is asking the question here hey do you think you can compete with tesla's margins and let me provide you the ceo of ford's response he starts off by saying that's a very important crush question the reality is we will we we are structuring our portfolio to compete in very specific segments now if you just read the transcript there it seems like he's saying we will get to 20 gross margins but i actually went to listen to the audio and he corrected himself he didn't confirm that they will he kind of stumbled over that the way i just said it was kind of like he did the reality is we we were restructuring to our portfolio to compete in very specific segments crossover is turning to be more core civic to the ev business blah blah blah talks about the lightning being sold out even though they are not profitable on the ev segment we'll talk about that in just a moment the real driver of our future profitability is on second cycle products and this is really interesting because listen to them talk about the iterative process of manufacturing we didn't know when we designed the first three ev products we didn't know that wiring harnesses for the maki were longer than they needed to be we didn't know that batteries were heavier than they needed to be we didn't know that we under invested in braking technology to save on battery size in other words they're basically saying look we've been really unprofitable at evs because we don't know what we're doing with ev manufacturing but we're learning okay that's super normal right so far very very normal to expect the iterative process of manufacturing to make a better uh to make a better vehicle right to be clear this is the earnings call so this is not an article this is an earnings call from ford so they talk about how they need they're learning how to manufacture better and they're very optimistic they're also very optimistic because they have a lot of new talent now don't get me wrong but when i hear they have a lot of new talent it kind of suggests that the old talent just don't know how to make electric vehicle and that's because obviously they're in the internal combustion engine business now what's interesting here is they're basically selling this idea that we want to make cars with fewer parts the ceo of ford is basically handing it to tesla who's making cars with fewer parts via their giga presses but that's not even the entertaining part let's keep going we want to play hard our strength our commercial truck larger vehicles on the category side we don't want to have too many choices this was a little the transcription here wasn't great but basically they're saying we don't want to have too many cars for people to choose from because that puts a lot of costs on our engineers and we're trying to be more profitable on electric vehicles so we want to give people fewer cars to choose from which is the opposite of what legacy car automakers usually do and it's exactly what tesla does you don't have that many choices it's kind of like ford back in the 1920s henry ford you could have any cars that you want as long as it's black and it was basically just a black model t right and so they want they like that because you can have better margins when you do this they're also talking about designing smaller batteries for competitive size now i personally think that is actually really great and it's something that tesla's probably going to do in the future as well you're going to end up coming out with 20 kilowatt hour battery packs as soon as people get over the head that the mental head trip that you need a big ass battery that you're lugging around the fact of the matter is most people don't need a big battery in their car because what it does is it adds more weight and ruins your fuel efficiency you really only need 80 mile charges and you plug the thing in every night so you should have a daily commuter and then maybe a more long-range vehicle i think that's perfect because most households have multiple cars anyway so then this is where things get interesting okay he talks about how basically we have negative pricing on electric vehicles right now and this is very true ford does not expect to be profitable on electric vehicles until 2026. there's a company called uh ford authority they are a uh they're they're sort of a news organization it's kind of like a nine to five mac but for cars and uh here's the article from them where they talk about investing 50 billion dollars in electric vehicles in the next coming years how they're trying to produce 600 000 electric vehicles by the end of 2023 this is a recent article by the way from feb one here and what's interesting is 600 000 vehicles is a run rate of about 50 000 vehicles per month in 2022 guess how many vehicles ford produced per month that were electric they want to produce 50 000. guess how many they actually produced 12. okay they produced 12 000 vehicles so they wanted more than 4x how many vehicles they're making that are electric in their ramp process uh they expect to get to 2 million electric vehicles by 2026. however folks let's make it very very clear all you have to do is read the headline here and we already knew this ford electric vehicles still not expected to be profitable until 2026. think about that for a moment folks ford still can't figure out how to make a buck on electric vehicles today in 2023 as they're ramping they still can't figure it out neither can rivian rivian people are like oh tesla lost a lot of money as well when they were ramping their cars not on a gross profit margin basis tesla in 2014 when they produced as many vehicles as rivien about 7000 vehicles could actually go look at the earnings calls they're all public and the earnings reports tesla had about 20 percent gross margin all the way back to 2014. in 2014 when they were doing just 7 000 vehicles tesla was positive without energy credits let me let me just like demonstrate that to you here okay look 24 2014 tesla had 20 percent gross margin without credits it was like 29 gross margin with the credits okay that was in 2014 folks at the same time in 2022 rivian producing about the same amount as tesla then is negative substantially negative on their gross profit margin and in 2023 2024 and 2025 ford is also expected to have a negative gross margin and byd the only electric vehicle manufacturer that's actually remotely killing it is sitting at a margin of about 1.5 percent that's really really well that's i mean like they're they're gross margins a little higher let me not confuse that here let's let's just stick with gross profit i'm sorry with byd just pretend i didn't say that for a moment because byd that's their net margin that's not fair that's their bottom line their gross margin is a little higher uh actually they you know they they that's how they actually are remotely profitable uh is they make ice vehicles they make uh hybrid vehicles and they're they're definitely a better company than uh when it comes to making vehicles than like rivien or ford these guys can't figure it out uh but the point is that tesla back in the day of a relatively similar production of of rivian was able to figure it out ford still can't figure it out they're not figuring it out today they can't figure it out going forward and they probably won't figure it out until 2026 and i hate to say it but even as you get to 2026 it's just hopium if they actually end up making it profitable which is kind of accountable if you think about it it's kind of embarrassing in my opinion now not only is that embarrassing but this is where things get really embarrassing i hate to say it but this is where the earnings call just goes ugly you ready for this so in the earnings call they talk about what becomes more critical because they realize that in the future there's going to be more competition for electric vehicles and they actually literally say and because of that competition quote we have to expect negative pricing okay now after they talk about negative pricing they talk about electric vehicle software becoming more critical for the business now this is where things in my opinion actually get laughable because the analysts ask them hey how are you ever going to get profitable right how are you ever going to make money on electric vehicles and what ford says is the following i'm going to play the audio of it so you could hear it because i thought it was fun i also posted it on twitter ready for this here we go play audio on twitter now not the ev platforms but our new fully updated electrical architecture because what we've learned on pro is we can make real money on software not our batteries all right what you learned on pro for it is that we can make real money on software and he kind of says it like a creep it felt very creepy listening to the earnings call the way you said it but yeah but beyond me just like bagging on the way he said it let's think about what he just said he was asked by an analyst do you think you can get to 20 gross profit margins and he talks about trying to make the manufacturing process better we know they're not going to be profitable until 2026 we know they can't figure out how to make evs profitable and at the same time he's warning that electric vehicles are going to be a negative pricing market and so how does he end the answer he ends the answer with we can make real money on software and i'm like dude what software clown that's what i wrote on twitter because i'm sincere with that what software what software i'll tell you what software they're talking about they're talking about the following they're talking about their their blue cruise or whatever you call it yeah it's ford's bluecrest and basically they refer to this idea that consumer reports suggest that blue cruise is a better active driving assistance system than tesla and what they do is when you go to the ratings you'll actually see that some of the heaviest weights are the following keeping driver engaged nine out of ten for ford unresponsive driver 6 out of ten clear when safe to use nine out of ten yeah that's because you could barely use it anywhere so they give these bigger ratings for four when you scroll down to tesla it says keeping driver engaged three out of ten clear when safe to use three out of ten unresponsive driver 4 out of ten and what they say is the following listen to this this is ridiculous okay this is the bagging that they give tesla you ready for this it is also disappointing that advanced driver autonomy systems for some automakers allow their vehicles to drive for a long time without the driver applying any pressure to the steering wheel so wait a second let's pause for a moment let's just think about what he said for a moment this author of this consumer reports article is saying it's disappointing that you don't have to grab the steering wheel and wobble it more often in other words it's disappointing that you have to be annoyed less look when i'm driving and my car is steering i don't want to have to wiggle the damn wheel all the time it's annoying it's really annoying i sit there i watch what the car is doing and if there's a case where i get nervous i grab the wheel and make sure it does the right thing which it usually does thankfully knock on wood if i need to take over i take over i'm paying attention but i don't need to sit there like this the whole time the car is driving itself it's stupid this is why the cameras now make you pay attention to the road with your eyes instead of always having these manual inputs ah but what does consumer reports say they just happen to also be uh you know get fundraising for fundraising and pro and remember consumer reports as a non-profit they you know there there's a lot of legacy auto uh and old school legacy auto and oil industries that are sort of backing uh consumer reports so there's some tinfoil hat you can put on regarding that but we won't go down that road let's just literally look at the words that they're saying and the words they're using are again it is disappointing that automakers allow their vehicles to drive for a long time without requiring the driver to apply any pressure to the steering wheel let alone make sure the driver is actually paying attention to the road in our tests both mercedes and tesla allowed the vehicle to drive down the highway for about 30 seconds before the first audible alert was given to the driver to put a hand back on the steering wheel so to this i tweeted and i wrote yo mike monticello and consumer reports did you really sandbag tesla versus ford because quote it's disappointing tesla allowed the vehicle to drive 30 seconds before the first audible alert was given to the driver to put their hand back on the steering wheel how much is ford paying you serious it's ridiculous so in other words consumer reports is trying to prop up the ford software by bagging on tesla because tesla doesn't nag you enough at the same time the ford ceo is talking about how important software is to their margins because when they're asked about ever being able to get to 20 gross margin they are basically punting and saying we don't think we can ever do that without software what software jim what software y'all suck there's no surprise your stock went down six percent because you just gave terrible guidance for the future of your ability to actually compete with evs now what's crazy is a lot of people actually invest in the value traps like ford because they think oh well they know how to manufacture cars they're going to be able to make it well apparently not it's really embarrassing very embarrassing now i'll give you some highlights okay some highlights because i don't just want to be bad the forward lightning is sold out well that's because they barely make the lightning again they were only able to make about 12 000 vehicles a month uh last year they hope to grow that but by growing that they're just going to lose even more money i hate to say that again i'm not trying to be mean here i'm just being a realist ford lost money they had not only negative net income look it's on screen i'm not making this stuff up here's the ford motor company consolidated statement of cash flows for the period ending december 31st 2022. net income minus 2.1 billion dollars not only did they lose money on a net basis but guess what folks and this is before we actually have the pricing war happening they lost money before the pricing cuts and now they want to ramp evs and lose money more until 2026 ford is going to be losing money year after year after year and it and if they can't make it they're either going to continue getting subsidized by their shareholders and they'll have to continue to take on even more debt or they'll go bankrupt and somebody else will take over the sort of the ideas of the lightning but what do you have over here oh my gosh you don't even have free cash flow you have 6.8 billion dollars of operating cash but you spent 6.866 on capital spending you've got negative free cash flow about 13 million dollars that's not that terrible you're pretty close but basically any kind of cash flow you actually have you're blowing into losing more money it's embarrassing okay trying to look at some other i'll try try to find some other bright sides here what do we have they're building battery plants in tennessee uh kentucky europe they're building a new battery facility in turkey enjoy the 68 inflation you got over there ford expects to have a hundred percent of the raw material in lock by the end of the year so they can actually make these cars that's great lock in all that raw material pricing now so when deflation happens y'all are still stuck at high prices that's fine average retail price of a ford is 56 500 compared to forty nine thousand dollars for average across all brands and 52 000 for tesla that's actually interesting the average price of a ford is more expensive than the average price of a tesla or the average price of a regular car yet some people like to go test is a luxury auto manufacturer so is ford then as well it's ford also then a luxury auto manufacturer if the average retail price of a ford is more expensive than a tesla it's ridiculous it is a ludicrous some of these people who prop up these legacy automakers on a pedestal suggesting that oh but their valuation is good yeah because they're a value trap come on step bro you stuck ford expects to build up to high volumes they're bragging about having the best hands-free automotive system on the market thanks to the consumer reports tweet uh or post it's ridiculous they do expect a mild recession in the united states and europe they expect higher industry incentives as supply and demand comes back into balance uh they expect tailwinds because of improvements in supply chains great they complained a lot about supply chains being very inefficient and uh they hope things get better not only in materials but also in freight because they took a nine billion dollar headwind in 2022. and going forward to 2023 they actually expect a tailwind on this department but they still lose their money ah man i i don't know i i don't know like you know some people they they uh uh they they really want to ignore fundamentals and i i don't know how much more blunt ford could be that they're a terrible advisement now that's not to say that their stock won't rise with the stupidity of the market just the ocean of the market going up but if fundamental companies and fundamentals are going to shine through in 2023 i don't want to be anywhere close to this trash ah man that was exhausting platform architecture is not well set up like tesla's ford uses unreal engine to build on android app to run on the dark horse for example you know i don't really know what that means but it sounds like you're reiterating what i'm saying so it sounds good thanks for the five euros for saying that uh you know that could have bought you one month of membership here on on the chat here do you expect a pullback due to tensions on nvidia um you might have some more temporary short-term shorting on on chipmakers because of this uh for me the chip makers are by the dip opportunity i'm a big fan man um yeah oh man okay now we've we've got even more stuff to talk about there's a lot uh so let's uh let's see here any any other questions we have in the meantime here let me just scroll up for a moment let's take a look a little one minute breather here and uh and then we'll get to our next topic here so uh hey small good decisions you just became a member thanks man welcome board um because that's biden's clone oh my gosh all right kevin why does the market continue to price in rate cuts this year when the fed has no it says no way it'll happen well it's a good question and it's a fair question but you have to remember that the federal reserve works expectations they try to manipulate the market to do what they want and they want inflation expectations to go down so actually the best thing that you can have at the fed is an aggressive posture while actually being willing to flip-flop if inflationary data actually comes in low see the worst thing the fed could do right now is go we're good let's start cutting rates because then everybody's going to go yolo spending like crazy again everybody's gonna go buy a house everybody's going to get back into real estate treasury yields will plummet to two percent or one and a half percent again everybody will borrow again and you'll get your inflation right back so the fed actually in a weird way has to kind of lie to us and i know that sounds aggressive but to some degree they have to and jerome powell doesn't like a line that's why in his press conference a few days ago he was actually a little bit soft because he doesn't like lying but that's basically what he has to do he has to lie to us to make us feel like they're being more aggressive now if data comes in bad they will be more aggressive that's very clear right if the inflation comes in bad they'll be more aggressive but by them actually having the space of yeah we're not talking about cuts it's actually a good thing uh and it reiterates the nike swoosh scenario and thesis the way ford uses unreal engine to implement the hmi system in a 3d environment is not capable enough to set up the architecture for autonomous driving i feel like you just went from explaining that to a 30 year old to explaining that to a 29 year old and in other words it's still pretty impressive i i don't i don't know hmi system i need it i need it for like a five-year-old hmi systems can provide custom design solutions for electronics and software engineering yeah i don't i don't know what that means what's an hmi system hardware or software through which the operator interacts with a controller and that doesn't help me much either human machine interface oh the the little buttons you push okay so what's next up we have jim the short seller oh we got a lot to talk about with jim and a short seller so let's do that let's see here jim the short seller missing men in the workforce hold on what's this from fox dancing with the stars samantha harris who turned yoga to help her own battle oh i thought this was actually going to be about the workforce it's not it's just showing people doing yoga poses thanks fox all right so a short seller uh known as uh i just call him jim c uh he uh he has a message for us so let's go ahead and look at his message and then we're going to comment about consumer spending and his message so let's see here all right let's get started let's bring in fame oops that's a little loud now we're going to talk about a short seller why he's short the market and we're also going to talk about what's going on with consumer savings consumer spending and which companies could actually win bigly i think this is going to be one not only you want to want to watch in full but you're going to want to pay attention to the companies i mentioned at the end of this because they're not my traditional companies that i talk about but let's first listen to why this guy jim is shorting the market hedge fund dude coming to you out of miami in an interview with cnbc let's listen in what does he have to say let's bring in fame shorts though this is our headliner for this evening jim chanos founder of chanos and company jim it's a pleasure to have you with us thanks so much for joining us welcome to my hood i know your new hood or not relatively relatively new under 20 years oh 20 years i didn't realize how long um what do you make of this this memo this notion that that we could be at war with china it feels like people don't want to believe it or don't believe it yeah i mean the the war in the pacific is serious stuff i mean let's not forget we have a land war in europe going on right now i mean sort of the world war ii tanks artillery since we haven't really seen in in our lifetimes and um so shooting war in in the pacific you know all pets are off i mean i i certainly hope that doesn't happen and um but yeah i mean it it upsets everything because of what god said i mean whether it's supply chains um whatever i mean we having having china go to war with the west would be just apocalyptic how does that factor in if at all all to your view on china and how you view that mark in terms of opportunities for you yeah um well obviously our view on china which is now 12 years old i mean has been based on the financial system and the debt and real estate markets over there and not a whole lot changes obviously china will become more insular um i've been watching the the china reopening trade like everybody else has for the last six or nine months um and uh it's sort of marveling at it um but i don't think there's any way to handicap it from my perspective as a hedge fund manager i mean again if it happens it's uh it the unintended consequences would be severe okay so a little bit of a warning about maybe war with china but let's be real i don't even think he expects that tail risk is going to happen so let's get into why maybe a little bit more he's actually short jim do you think though you know going forward we're just seeing you know i guess the um you know the situation with russia and ukraine was so simple u.s multinationals had to take a stand about the uh the russian aggression it's a little different with china when you think about our reliance from a manufacturing standpoint our u.s multinationals interest in that emerging middle class which has been a part of the bull case for 20 years now in china how would that play out because i really feel like that could change the dynamic for a lot of u.s companies yeah i mean again i think that that we're far more intertwined into the asian economies in particular china and and so i want to mention here holy smokes the amount of investments starbucks is making into china insane i just went through the starbucks earnings call and i'll probably do a separate video on it but it's worth mentioning that in 2018 starbucks had 3521 stores in china by 2022 they added almost all of the stores that they added 97 of the stores china uh or that that starbucks added in the world went to china 97 of them another 1737 stores and they uh they're now at about 6 000 stores here in q1 6100 i believe yeah 6100 q1 2023 q3 2022 they were about 53.58 and they expect to get to 9 000 stores in china china and by uh 2025. now it's remarkable about that growth is their their starbucks is really telling you they're screaming at you we think that uh they're gonna make it uh they're gonna make big profits big attendees in uh in china let's keep going we'll see uh anything that that would end that and bring it into a cold war much less a shooting war um i mean just has to be it has to be just a major major event for not only markets but geopolitics i mean it's yeah it's scary stuff jim we talked about multiples of this market expensive not expensive i mean thirty thousand feet what are your thoughts and again that don't fight the fed mantra that's been out there for some reason people want to look past it when it doesn't sort of line up with the market going higher for them um well i think you know we we don't try to time the market um but like anybody else i have opinions and things are not cheap i mean they're not as expensive as they were say a year and a half ago um on the other hand um the market is at 18 times forward um profit margins are all-time highs so that has not been reverted and one of the most mean reverting time series in all of economics and finance is corporate profitability and it's been stubbornly good and and high um but since i've been on the street in 1980 not one bear market has ever traded above 9 to 14 times the previous peak earnings so whether it's 87 89 90 90 . i just want to take a quick pause there and mention what he's saying is that we are at such a high level of essentially our multiples now on the s p 500 our price to earnings multiple right we're willing to pay 19 times s p projected earnings for the s p right now and jim is suggesting we've got to get to probably 9 to 14 because historically that's where s p 500 earnings go now i actually do not disagree with this it is one of the reasons that i really believe you have to invest in individual companies versus just the s p 500 over at least the next year to two because i think s p 500 companies are going to get reamed with earnings uh well many of them whereas individual companies that that you can select might end up showing improving more pricing power through this sort of recessionary dynamic and you might actually see a lot more earnings growth now no guarantees okay it's not personalized financial advice for you but that is at least something that i think individuals would have to consider let's keep going for the 2002 or 09 um if you think earnings are peaking now give at 200. um that's a long way down right that's 1800 to 2800. um we're not anywhere near that and uh and so you have to hope earnings hold up um and you have to hope i mean look right now the market in the in the space of really six seven months has gone to corporate profits are going to be up 12 this year inflation's coming down to two percent the fed may be easing at the end of the year i mean that's pretty much nirvana if you're a ball he's basically here saying hey look the market's pricing in great things corporate earnings up whatever he's making the bet against the spy basically that's but that's what markets actually forward pricing think right now they're wrong all the time but people are praising in a pretty pretty nice goldilocks scenario are you trading the markets directionally overall or is it just individual no i mean we in our hedge fund we are slightly net short slightly net long um and and so until recently we were actually slightly long i think we've gone to the back down to zero line plus or minus um and in our short only funds were 60 to 80 percent um and so it just depends on the individual names in those and and we try not to take a lot of systematic market risk in our hedge fund a lot changes that when you go from zero percent interest rates to what accelerate fundamental stories you bet against when you do your deep fund mental analysis so i'm wondering are there are there positions you think and look even better now if that service is too heavy a burden etc well one of the areas i'm marveling that is held up as well as it has with with a couple of exceptions and sub-sectors like office there's been commercial real estate um i just don't get people buying almost any kind of of commercial real estate that is that doesn't see good demand at this point at first of all hands down 100 correct the the fact that these these uh real estate funds are getting massive outflows right now totally makes sense to me like why would you buy real estate and get you know uh five percent cash flow when you could just invest in robinhood and get four point one five percent like if it doesn't make sense and this is exactly why we see this as first of all we see a big compression coming in valuation for real estate which is exactly what we're preparing for with my real estate startup house hack the whole point of house hack is to wait for the pain and then get in right uh and then we've got some really phenomenal ideas in terms of maximizing cash flow and being able to sort of cycle wedge deals over and over and over again which we're really excited about uh and and obviously we're working to bring to non-accredited investors as well if you're accredited you have a big advantage by going to househack.com reading the solicitation there and potentially investing uh before uh the end of february or the end of march because you get some more bonuses for future potential warrants which are somewhat kind of like call options that you get for free they're different read the website you'll learn more about it but anyway totally agree right now that real estate especially some of the reits really expensive especially commercial like office rate we just had a new york developer start giving stuff back to the bank and i hate it when people say that because it basically just means you sucked and you had to turn around and give up and admit an l but this new york developer is like yeah i'm giving properties back to the bank i'm just handing the keys back to the bank and i'm like you know it doesn't really work that way like you're getting foreclosed on is what it is uh it's it's disappointing but uh anyway let's listen and hear more to the short seller and then we'll add some commentary about u.s consumers they're spending and where we might be going with consumer debt three percent four percent five percent so-called cap rates it makes no sense and sl green which we are short new york offices i've been short now for a couple years trades at a five percent cap rate and it's levered massively to its cash flow um and i just don't want to buy new york office buildings right now at a five percent cap when the balance sheet is leveraged 15 to one it just makes it and i mean then there's all kinds of stories like this out there in the commercial real estate um as you know we're short the data centers which i think is one of the worst businesses i've ever seen um they traded 100 times earnings and and earnings of the metric because capex equals depreciation uh is that wrong i mean some of the the data center wreaths trade very very expensively uh i personally prefer investing in the chips i don't know i feel like chips themselves are like the uh the pickaxe the backbone of it all and so there's just all sorts of odd anomalies in the valuation space of things that are just in the stratosphere still that sort of make no sense to us yeah sometimes things look cheap and they're actually more expensive than like the intel quarter for example was a disaster in that world debt ceiling in a politics are boring we don't really talk about them and i'm not suggesting we're going to go down 2011 path when u.s debt got downgraded but it's clear that there's a faction of people that want to push the envelope on this is that something that concerns you or we just sort of slide through this like we typically do no i mean again it's another black that would be kind of another black swan that no one thinks will happen including me um i i mean just when push comes to shove i think we're going to pay the interest on our debt um but who knows it could be wrong all right so there's our little cnbc interview now we've got to talk about the consumer here because the consumer i think is going to be a big piece of this as well as a market so uh first of all is is it possibly true that uh you know there's more pain to come in markets absolutely in fact here's the biggest thing reiterating jim's point right here this chart right here is called the yield curve it is the three month ten year and if i hide myself for a moment what you could do is you can compare the.com crash of the yield curve here to the great recession yield curve bottom to uh approximately the 2020 yield curve inversion uh and then which is anything under zero which is over here right so there's your zero line to where we sit now which is massively inverted and folks look at when the yield curve hit its lowest point it was at the beginning of 2001. you still had another year to go of hell before the markets bottom markets didn't actually bottom until over in this region substantially higher when the yield curve went substantially positive again the yield the markets did not bottom in the great recession until the yield curve was substantially positive again in fact it went super negative at the beginning of 2017. now that's the remarkable part about this market is the biggest thing that bears have going for them right now is that historically the yield curve is suggesting the most painful part is actually still ahead the only reason you could suggest that the most painful part is not ahead of us would be to argue that well wait a minute the entire reason markets are selling down is because the fed is trying to get rid of inflation as long as inflation goes away and the fed can then relax earnings per share will continue to grow they'll go back to growth we'll put the pain of 2022 in the beginning of 2023 behind us and we'll be right back to growing and booming that's sort of the bullish idea and it's really the basis in the argument of this time is different which are the four most dangerous words in investing this time is different very dangerous so that gives a lot of credence to short sellers so we always want to be as neutral as possible on a channel obviously everybody's got their biases but the goal is to be as neutral as possible and look you got to give credit where credit's due the yield curve is the most concerning part now you could try to explain this away you could say that we had structural differences between the recession of 2001 where you had basically an econ a market that was running solely on tech valuations which had bubbled to insane levels and has collapsed our market today is so much more diverse our economy is so much more diverse and by having a so much more diverse economy it doesn't really matter that certain like spax or whatever here recently have fallen like 90 or a broader economy and the consumer is still strong we'll talk about that consumer in a moment now potentially businesses can take this as an opportunity to invest kind of like you're seeing chipotle doing you're seeing the chips companies doing you're seeing a lot of companies throughout america saying look the hard part is going away the second half of 2023 should be very strong for them that's the argument will that hold true we don't know but we're also looking at different structural causes of a crash now than we had in 2006 and seven in 2006 and seven you had a real estate disaster dead people getting loans people who couldn't qualify for loans getting teaser rates of negative interest rates that ended up adjusting to seven percent and then they had to go into foreclosure so you had a foreclosure crisis we don't actually really have a clear fundamental disaster that we could see right now but then again that's why they call it a black swan because maybe we're just blind to that potential black swan and maybe that black swan is coming and then we could go oh yeah there were real fundamental problems in which case the inverted yield curve would be correct that the pain is still ahead of us and that gives credence to what short sellers like mr jim are saying now other folks look at what consumers are doing and say that consumers are basically building up a consumer credit bubble in fact cnbc just posted yesterday this particular piece here which shows that u.s credit card debt jumped 18.5 and hit a record total credit according to transunion hit a record annual aprs are already sitting at 20 on average basically needing more and more money of individuals uh income is going to debt payments you've got the an average balance on credit cards of 5.8 thousand dollars and you're returning to levels of consumer debt uh in terms of a payment of their personal disposable income that resemble what we saw before the pandemic in other words we're getting back to levels where people are spending more potentially than than they're actually able to save and this is very easy to see by just looking at the personal savings rate a personal savings rate was just 3.4 percent in december that is a disaster compared to the usual five to six percent where we sit and it's certainly a disaster relative to the covet era but then again we were getting a lot of money that we could save uh via stimulus checks so we are in this little consumer savings glut at the same time as people are taking on more debt and at the same time that we're actually going back to 2019 levels of spending uh debt spending as a percentage of personal disposable income now the good news is if you compare to the last recessions the.com bubble and the great recession or the recessions of the 80s you actually had consumers spending households households were spending over 11 of their disposable income on debt we're at 9.7 right now which is in line with the lower levels of about 9.7 between 2010 and 2020. now that one percentage point doesn't really seem like a difference but between 11 and 13 is where we sat during the recessions and if you see the chart either it's actually a substantial difference so we've got a substantial way to go however this is where i think the problem could actually come if inflation rears its head again then you're in this really interesting environment because think about this for a moment what i think you have right now is right now you have people borrowing they're taking on more debt to get through the inflationary period right so debt now as a bridge think of it as a bridge right you're bridging to get through the painful period so yes consumers are taking on more debt this is just my theory as long as inflation goes down then we can refinance the debt and that debt payment as a percentage of this personal disposable income plummets again we have to rely on being able to refinance that debt however if we get a second wave of inflation this debt stays expensive and then we potentially go back to the this this sort of era that we had in prior recessions where people are spending way more money on their own debt as a percentage of their disposable income so you go back to 2006 and 2007 2008 2009. you go back to a.com bubble and you actually confirm what the bond curves are telling you you confirm that the worst part is still yet to come and then guess who ends up being right jim the short seller so if debt is not just a bridge but it actually stays because inflation pops up again then the bond markets inversion of the yield curve will be correct the painful period is still to come the earnings decline is still to come the s p 500 is still to fall the short sellers will be correct as earnings collapse the market will go to crop however if inflation goes down and that fundamental reason for a crash now goes away then guess what could end up booming and this is what i teased earlier with which companies could win all of this debt that's being taken on on credit cards in excess of 20 right now or personal loans that are being taken on like crazy right now something crazy is going to happen to that debt let me just reiterate currently what's happening with personal loans look at sofi's earnings okay three months ended december 20 uh 21 .6 billion dollars in personal loans done by sofi one year later 2.46 billion dollars in other words a 50 increase in personal loans at so far sofi is taking money and deposits and they're lending it out like crazy which means people are borrowing money like crazy and this is reiterated by what we're seeing in the numbers this is why sofi beat on those earnings they're making a lot of new loans not only are they making a lot of new loans but credit card debt is skyrocketing consumer credit has been skyrocketing we get new consumer credit numbers next week so yeah you've got a lot of crazy numbers going on in the world of debt but what happens if indeed those inflationary numbers go down and all of that debt what's going to happen to that debt focus what kind of boom are we going to have if inflation falls let's write it down if inflation plummets who wins and what companies win that we haven't talked about yet refinance companies baby think about it any lender who makes money off of making loans wins so that's probably going to be companies like sofi because think about it the loans they have are more valuable because they're paying a higher interest rate and if people refinance those loans so far wins because you have more refinancing income and more more actual processing revenue right and their costs go down who else wins probably think about like a rocket mortgage or what about a uwm right uh united wholesale mortgage company the real estate mortgaging companies win because a lot of people have been buying homes with interest rates between five to seven percent rates go back to three percent you're gonna have a huge refinancing boom and so you're going to have some companies with massive pp massive pricing power if that inflation comes down we have that uh that uh refinancing boom and then all of the debt that consumers have taken on actually doesn't become that big of a deal you could have consumer debt as a percentage of disposable income right now literally as high as 2007 levels but if rates plummet and people refinance in a way that burden goes down really really fast also think about this autos the entire auto sector will be a whole lot more affordable for people to go buy cars because then they can go finance cars again at three percent instead of you know the five to seven percent they're paying right now so you will as long as inflation falls consumers what they're doing is they're borrowing through this recession i really believe that to be true that consumers and businesses are borrowing through this recession i believe that's what's happening and if the recession lasts longer we're screwed right so if inflation doesn't plummet and the recession lasts longer we're screwed but if inflation plummets and therefore rates plummet the refinance companies win bigly the autos win bakery and we don't end up having an eps disaster at uh at american companies why because people can keep spending so that's a really big thesis and sort of a big conclusion there that all of this credit spend is inflating a massive bubble but that bubble would actually be manageable if inflation continues to go down if inflation pops back up we're all screwed it's that simple so that's why looking at the inflationary numbers is very important looking at the jobs report yesterday was important because it reiterated the downtrend on average hourly earnings but it also reiterated that we could potentially dodge a recession in that maybe we don't need uh a bunch of people to lose their jobs people losing their jobs is bad for recession right best case scenario we don't lose a bunch of jobs and inflation just goes away best case scenario it's a goldilocks scenario and that's somewhat what markets uh some markets are pricing in now with the fed potentially uh writing uh well basically uh with with markets pricing that the fed's going to cut rates eventually so we shall see we shall see all right that was a big piece on short selling and the consumers let's see here uh it does look like we just got a tweet a tweed a little lou from elon musk let's see here um elon musk is just an impulsive kid with a terrible twitter habit alex spyro in court his uh his uh uh attorney and uh elon laughed at that and says that's fair all right very well let's look at some questions we have here we on twitch now heck yeah sir this is mad money with kevin thank you i appreciate it we should call it that although then cnbc will probably sue us we don't want that we like cbc okay even if you counter trade them we like them how do you think the market will be affected by the fact that the fed changes the inflation calculating method um you mean the cpi weights i don't think much i think they're just trying to get rid of the 2020 abnormalities by not using two-year weights they're using one year weights and the weights i don't think are going to move that terribly much so i think there's a whole lot about nothing over that but uh we'll see love the sweater oh thank you for that uh it's almost getting time for me to go make another cup of coffee and you know i can't get up right now because i may not be wearing pants maybe i'm not even wearing underwear nobody knows uh i'm not borrowing for my company or my family while interest rates are this high i prepared for this in 2020 21 and 2022 by saving two years see smart that's smart lending club is good too for consolidating debt good call cynthia vibes thanks for being a a member over here pants are for closer aren't pants are not foreclosers there we go closers let's go after we close the deals it's beer time no i i would never drink i'm not german do you think this rally will keep running through next week i think qqq and spy are going to fill their upper gaps um well look uh i think that shorts are very likely to reload their shorts uh the shot kind of shorts before cpi uh so i i would not make bets on a massive rally before cpi here this market is going to be very tentative and even if we are right that inflation is going to go down just like companies are telling us i really really believe my base case scenario with a 70 plus percent likelihood is that this was 2022 and that we're gonna see this going up basically i'm just drawing a very volatile nike swoosh and we're going to have these little rally runs and then we're going to have the shorts reloading and then the route the shorts are going to get squeezed again and then we're going to have the the reloads of the shorts again and basically it's going to be a very stressful year but i do think it will trend up will your jet be ready my jet should be flying again uh i let's see on monday wait are we installing this weekend we might be installing this weekend we're installing new windshields this weekend uh so i should be able to fly come monday tuesday probably not monday uh but but maybe as early as tuesday or wednesday i'm very excited to fly again like i'm i'm just like i'm itching to plug uh i gotta get out there and i gotta meet my real estate peeps that's the only reason i got the plane by the way people people um hold on a sec here i'll uh let me just explain um all right so you know there are a lot of people like oh kevin's just trying to justify buying a private jet like no i think buying a private jet is a very bad idea uh i think it's it's like an extravagance for most people and most people end up selling their private jet because it's stupid it's like yay you eat around on it for a little bit but then you're like damn this is expensive and this is a bad business idea that's and because it probably wasn't actually a business idea for people it was just sort of like a flashy you know consumer good um that's the case for i think many people who individually buy planes for corporations who buy planes as long as there is a real business use case the amount of time that you can save with a plane is remarkable and i think it's a necessity uh for me to be able to personally build an actual physical relationship with other real estate agents uh brokers lenders wholesalers in various different markets i don't think anybody can do that for me not yet we have to build the reputation first and real estate reputations are not built over zoom they're not built over the phone they are built in person they are built shaking hands and meeting properties in person they are showing up to the electrician doing work and making other people recognize that you were there not just for accountability purposes but also relationship purposes people want to build relationships with the people they're working with real estate is a people business it is the complete opposite of the stock market you cannot do real estate if you are not there in person and it is impossible for me to actually run multiple businesses without being able to fly around trips in a single day and so again you know some people they try to you know i think they're just jelly i think they're trying to justify it's like this me buying a plane is the greatest potential evidence that i could give house sac investors it is basically me saying i am signing my own personal income away for for future years and risking uh my own personal net worth uh for the foundation of this company because the company's not even paying for the plane like house hack right but it's basically me saying i believe in the future potential of house hike so much i'm willing to put my personal money at stake to make sure i am most well positioned to lead that company it's kind of crazy but then again you have to be crazy i think to actually hopefully become a very successful uh ceo with house hack um you know i think i think uh as to take the entrepreneurial risks that entrepreneurs take uh you know it's it's most people shouldn't take that those sort of risks it's also very stressful but hey uh you know we're not in prohibition so cheers anyway all right so uh yeah i as long as you don't go on any vacations in 2023 maybe we could have a healthy bull market yeah no kidding i might not i don't know that we're gonna hit many vacations this year like lauren asked me earlier she's like kevin we should plan a vacation in hawaii and go i ain't planning any vacations uh and first of all my plane can't make it to hawaii so i'm definitely not going to hawaii uh and she's like what no i want to go to hawaii then we'll fly a commercial i go no i'm first of all i don't have time for a vacation this year and second of all i need to buy a private plane to get back on a regular plane uh yeah i think it's i think hawaii is like 22 nautical miles away from us and uh my plane only makes it 2200 knots but you need to have a 22 or about a 10 buffer so oh woe is me i can't make it to hawaii but we're not buying in hawaii anyway at least not now we'd have to upgrade in the future uh we've we've got plenty we have we have really we have a a pretty neat formula that we can't wait to reveal it's gonna it's gonna be very very exciting but 2023 is going to be a hard a pretty difficult year of hard work i think so you need a bigger jab yeah that's that's for the expansion phase oh that's i don't know give it give it five years i i don't want to get into higher costs so the minimize costs right now this thing we got right now is pretty efficient uh i know that sounds crazy because there are no jets that are even remotely efficient relative to like cars obviously in terms of like fuel economy and stuff but relative to private jets this is probably one of the most efficient business uh class chats anyway yeah there you have it so thank you so much for being here thank you for listening into another meet kevin report i will see you again tomorrow same time same place thanks for being here remember you can listen to this on apple podcast google podcast youtube twitch facebook wherever you want to listen to it you can spotify uh spotify a little later on the podcast a little later because i uploaded after i post here and uh and we will be changing the pricing now for the courses uh i've got to get to work on working on removing those coupons so it's technically still probably going to be active for like another hour or so uh but that's our final coupon we're getting rid of that thank you so much for being here appreciate y'all we'll see y'all soon\""
